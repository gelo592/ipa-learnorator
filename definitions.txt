places of articulation

bilabial - consonant articulated with both lips

labiodental - consonant articulated with the lower lip and upper teeth

dental - consonant articulated with the tongue against the upper teeth

alveolar - consonant articulated with the tongue against or close to the alveolar ridge (teeth and hard palate of mouth)

post-alveolar - consonant articulated with the tongue near or touching the back of the alveolar ridge

retroflex - consonant articulated with the tongue flat or curled between the alveolar ridge and the hard palate

palatal - consonant articulated with the body of the tongue raised against the hard palate (roof of mouth)

velar - consonant articulated with the back part of the tongue against the soft palate

uvular - consonant articulated with the tongue against or near the uvula (behind velar consonants)

pharyngeal - consonant articulated primarily in the pharynx

glottal - consonant articulated primarily in the glottis


voiced - a sound in which the vocal cords vibrate

voiceless - a sound in which the vocal cords do not vibrate


manners of articulation

plosive / stop - consonant in which the vocal tract is blocked so airflow ceases

nasal - consonant produced with a lowered velum allowing air to escape freely through nose

trill - consonant produced by vibrations between the active articulator and passive articulator.

tap / flap - consonant produced with a single contraction of the muscles so that one articulator (such as tongue) is thrown against another

fricative - consonant produced by forcing air through a narrow channel made by placing two articulators close together

affricative consonant that begins as a stop and releases as a fricative

lateral fricative - consonant in which the airstream proceeds along the the sides of the tongue, but is blocked in the middle of the mouth

approximant - consonant in which articulators approach each other, but without enough articulation to create turbulent airflow. They fall between fricatives and vowels.

lateral approximant - consonant in which the center of the tongue makes solid contact witht he roof of mouth. However, the side of the tongue only approches the teeth.
